# Kai Smart Features

## 🧠 Intelligent Error Detection & Auto-Fix

Kai now automatically detects common errors and suggests fixes!

### How It Works

When a command fails, Kai:
1. **Analyzes the error** - Examines exit code and error message
2. **Detects the problem** - Identifies common issues
3. **Suggests a fix** - Proposes the corrected command
4. **Asks for confirmation** - Lets you approve the fix
5. **Runs the fix** - Executes the corrected command automatically

## 🔧 Auto-Fix Examples

### 1. Shell Syntax Errors

**Problem:**
```
> git add . && git commit -m "test" && git push
$ git add . && git commit -m "test" && git push
/bin/sh: 1: Syntax error: "&&" unexpected
Command exited with code 2
```

**Kai's Smart Fix:**
```
💡 Smart Fix Detected:
Fixed: Shell syntax error. The command uses '&&' which requires bash, not sh.

Suggested command: bash -c 'git add . && git commit -m "test" && git push'

Run the fixed command? [Y/n]:
```

### 2. Command Typos

**Problem:**
```
> gti status
$ gti status
gti: command not found

## 📋 Error Analysis

When Kai can't auto-fix an error, it provides helpful analysis:

### Example: Network Error
```
> ping unreachable-host.com
$ ping unreachable-host.com
ping: unreachable-host.com: Name or service not known
Command exited with code 2

📋 Error Analysis:
Error: Network issue detected. Check your internet connection.
```

### Example: Disk Full
```
> dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=1G count=100
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=1G count=100
dd: error writing 'bigfile': No space left on device
Command exited with code 1

📋 Error Analysis:
Error: Disk is full. Free up some space and try again.
```

## 🎮 Interactive Command Support

Kai now supports interactive commands like vim, nano, top, etc.!

### How It Works

When you request an interactive command:
1. Kai detects it's interactive
2. Runs it without output capture
3. Gives you full terminal control
4. Returns to Kai when done

### Examples

```
> edit config.txt with nano
ℹ Running interactive command...
$ nano config.txt
[nano opens in full terminal mode]
[you edit the file]
[exit nano]
> 
```

```
> open vim to edit script.py
ℹ Running interactive command...
$ vim script.py
[vim opens in full terminal mode]
[you edit the file]
[exit vim]
>
```

```
> show system processes with htop
ℹ Running interactive command...
$ htop
[htop opens in full terminal mode]
[you monitor processes]
[exit htop]
>
```

### Supported Interactive Commands

- **Editors**: vim, vi, nano, emacs
- **Pagers**: less, more, man
- **Monitors**: top, htop, iotop
- **Interactive shells**: ssh, ftp, telnet
- **Database clients**: mysql, psql, mongo
- **And more!**
