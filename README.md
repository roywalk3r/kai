# Kai - Intelligent Terminal Assistant 🤖

Kai is an AI-powered terminal assistant that translates natural language into shell commands and executes them safely. It uses local LLM (via Ollama) to understand your intent and help you navigate the command line with ease.

## Features

✨ **Natural Language to Commands**: Describe what you want in plain English
🛡️ **Safety First**: Warns about dangerous or long-running commands
⚡ **Smart Execution**: Auto-timeout for runaway processes
📝 **Command History**: Track and replay previous commands
🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Rich terminal interface with colors and formatting
🔧 **Configurable**: Customize behavior via config file
💡 **Context Aware**: Remembers your working directory and environment
🔍 **Dry Run Mode**: Preview commands before execution
📚 **Command Suggestions**: Get help with common tasks

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- **Either:**
  - **Google Gemini API Key** (Recommended - Free, Fast) - [Get it here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
  - **OR** [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) with llama3 model (Local, Private)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roywalk3r/kai.git
cd kai
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Choose your AI model:**

   **Option A: Gemini (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Get API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   **Option B: Ollama (Local)**
   ```bash
   # Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai/
   ollama pull llama3
   ```

   See [GEMINI_SETUP.md](GEMINI_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Start Kai:
```bash
python main.py
```

Then interact naturally:
```
> list my files
> create a file called notes.txt with "Hello World"
> show me disk usage
> find all python files in this directory
```

### Special Commands

- `exit` or `quit` - Exit Kai
- `terminate` - Stop currently running command
- `history` - Show command history
- `help` - Show help information
- `config` - Show current configuration
- `dry-run on/off` - Toggle dry-run mode

### Configuration

Edit `~/.kai/config.json` to customize:

```json
{
  "timeout_seconds": 20,
  "default_model": "llama3",
  "auto_confirm_safe": false,
  "history_size": 100,
  "color_scheme": "default"
}
```

## Examples

### File Operations
```
> create a backup of my documents folder
> find all files larger than 100MB
> compress the logs directory
```

### System Information
```
> show me system resources
> what's my IP address
> check disk space
```

### Development Tasks
```
> find all TODO comments in python files
> count lines of code in this project
> show git status
```

## Safety Features

Kai includes multiple safety mechanisms:

1. **Dangerous Command Detection**: Warns before running potentially destructive commands
2. **Long-Running Detection**: Alerts for commands that might take a long time
3. **Auto-Timeout**: Automatically terminates commands after configurable timeout
4. **Confirmation Prompts**: Requires explicit confirmation for risky operations
5. **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview commands without executing them
